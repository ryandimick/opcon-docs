# Accessing the Solution

SMA Solution Manager is an application platform designed to host and give access to User Interface (UI) modules called Solutions. Users will see and have access only to the solution(s) to which they have privileges.

:::note
Solution Manager utilizes global application links. Each page URL contains information, such as the current item ID edition, current selections, and filters, which make them ideal for bookmarking or sharing with others.
